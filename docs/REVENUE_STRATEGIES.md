## 7. Feature Bounties & Sponsored Development 💰

### Concept
Users and businesses can pay to prioritize and accelerate implementation of specific features they need. This creates a direct feedback loop between user needs and development priorities while generating revenue.

**Similar to:** Bountysource, GitHub Sponsors, BugCrowd, Feature Upvote, Open Collective

### How It Works

#### Individual Feature Sponsorship
```

└── Get early access when implemented

Benefits for User:
├── Get feature faster (weeks vs months/years)
├── Direct influence on development
├── Recognition in release notes
├── Early beta access
└── Feature customization input
```

### Revenue Share Model (Alternative)

Instead of flat fee, offer revenue share:

Base License: $5k/year
+ 5-10% of their gross sales

Example:
Client charges $50k/installation
You receive: $5k base + $2.5k (5%) = $7.5k per installation

If they do 10 installations/year:
$5k + (10 × $2.5k) = $30k total
```
